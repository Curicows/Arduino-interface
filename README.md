# Arduino interface

That's my arduino interface created with menus to test some of sensors and will be used on my IoT project.

At the moment it only supports RTC, Relay, LCD display, IR receiver, DHT11 temperature sensor. With the time the supported sensor will expand.

Future idea:
- Lighting controller
- Wifi
- Door locker
- NFC card reader
- Aquarium automate temperature controller
- Android app for the controller of the house
